        <h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
        <p>Rousseau made his confessions, which has been imitated by many people later on. However, as I am neither that evil nor that pessimistic, I would rather like to share my gratitude here to those who has endured the imperfect me(s) and guided me towards where I am.</p>

        Thanks to my high school physics teachers for reserving my life-long interest in physics to the highest degree. They were being much kinder than they shall be when we brought the results that were supposed to be way better.
        <div class="quote">
            "We don't learn physics to win competitions. We learn physics to win Nobel Prizes."

        Thanks to all my primary, middle, and high school teachers for putting up with my lack of holiday homework and always being late in the morning. <span style="font-size: small; color: #494949;">(I swear those're no longer the case.) (Yet it still seems insane for a kid to have such boring homework for holiday, or wake up at 7 everyday.)</span>

            Many thanks to my middle and high school teachers for repecting me as if I were not a child. I'm still grateful for how considerate they were when guiding me through my adolescent that was full of doubt and confusion. (For that, I shall also thank Disney movies)
