            Here I'm going to introduce courses that I have taken following several critical disciplines. I will also demonstrate how they inspired me with brand-new viewpoints to inspect the world, as well as how I feel about my participation in these courses. <span style="color: black;">Actually, blocks below are in descending order in which I have believed as paths for me towards the world's truest truth. Feel free to <b>click on the blocks to shrink or expand</b> them. This page is still being updated.</span>

                When I first got familiar with AI, I was told there were basically two paths towards it -- from bottom to the top and from top to the bottom. Ideally I'm wishing to go both ways, and I think I'm sort of a bit close now. By the way, recently I find it possible that "clustering" can be attached with much greater significance. <br><br>
                What's worth noting is that PSYC 489 is offered in the psychology department, which introduces me to a more cognitively related perspective about machine learning and neural network, as well as interesting new concepts such as "analog" and "associative neural network". The former one is kind of like "representation" that we are talking about in ML domain nowadays, and the latter one makes me curious about why it has been in such silence. Overall, this course is about offering hands-on experiences of building neural networks from scratch, as "scientific" approaches rather than engineering ones according to professor.<br><br>
                These two threads are what I am currently working on, for which I have been longing since my 16 (please refer to "physics fundamentals" part in this page), and are supposed to be stuck with me for a considerable long period.

                This thread is exactly what our major is requiring us for, that is, understanding modern computers as basic systems down to the physical level. The best idea I get from this thread is likely building abstract levels, or in other words, different layers of interfaces, to form a really complicated control system. This is somehow similar to the role of feature extraction in machine learning, I suppose. By the way, my intuition tells me that building discrete logic systems is somehow related to the manner of neural networks. <br><br>
                These can be a bit too far. Overall, the coolest thing about this thread is still that it enable us to turn objective physical laws into precise systems that are highly abstract and functioning magically, which is exactly what "computer engineering" means (though the painful experiences of debugging are probably telling me that I wouldn't be a happy engineer).

                This is the most surprising, impacting, while curative line for me. My mind kept turning into completely different ones along this thread. Practically, up through this thread, I gradually abandoned my belief for the existence of findable natural fundamental truth. Instead, I started to inspect the society, economy, science, and techniques as illusions in our cognition, which helps me a lot in making good scores out of exams.<br><br>
                Yeah, Hume is my favorite philosopher. Bacon, Kant, and Wittgenstein are also awesome.

                This is the thread from which the previous thread saved me. All these courses were supposed to be assigned as engineering supplements, but they were given by professor <a href="https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/en/node/775">Thomas Honold</a>, who was an excellent pure mathematician from Germany. This changed everything. Frankly speaking I was rather delighted for the most of the time, though it became indeed tremendously challenging to finish the weekly assignments (yet I got the best explanation for the determinant I've ever seen). Almost all of them were freaking analysis problems in pure math manners of various domains, and my pride and belief made me insist on working by myself, paying consecutive 24 hours each week. I believed that I was chasing the most canonical way to describe the world even more than when I was learning physics
                (though later glimpse on others' work made me realize I was not that sensitive to skills, and it would be a pipe dream to avoid skills when doing math).
                <br><br>
                And yeah, both homework and midterms turned out great. However, I was missing two facts then. First was that the final assessment, which took the largest weight, was still supposed to be on application point of view, and secondly, it was not enough to solve problems with conclusions in limited time just by listening to the awfully rigorous proof constructions on lectures (which filled up the lecture time, with rare people in presence). It took me long enough to realize these, after my suffering from self-doubts for several months while crying over my final scores. Overall, still a great tour. I believe that what these courses have left me will keep in company with me in the following decade.

                This is a path which I was looking forward to since my 12. Miserably, when I just got in high school, I found myself limited in learning advanced physics topics. Hence, in my second year in high school, I angrily turned to explore the reasons why I was limited, and then got familiar with some concepts in cognitive science, neuroscience, and deep learning. That's just how I started my adventure in artificial intelligence. <br><br>
                
                What's fortunate was that understanding those physics topics didn't seem that challenging as soon as I was in college, which proved my hypothesis that the reason was no more than my limited working memory due to being just a little kid.
