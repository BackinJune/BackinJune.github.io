        <h1>Course Work Threads</h1>
        <p>In this section I'm going to introduce courses that I have taken following a couple of critical disciplines. I will also demonstrate how they inspired me with brand-new viewpoints to inspect the world, as well as how I feel about my participation in these courses. (hopefully this page won't be caught by the professors)</p>
