        <h2>About the Living Trade</h2>
        Basically we are all trading for living necessities with particular parts of our body, most of which will withstand wear or tear for use. However, brain can be considered as one of the rare exceptions that will even normally be polished after use. This leads to two benefits of living on brain -- sustainability of the trade and its continued growth.

        <h2>About Capital</h2>
        <p>Now I get the difference between socialism and capitalism. Basically, making significant social impacts will normally align with the growth of capital in capitalism, which will not be true in socialism. Socialism is designed to prevent the capital from having vital impacts on society.</p>

        <h2>Social Objectives</h2>
        <p>Every field has its objective, such as levels in video games, power in politics, and assets in business. In academia, that would be discoveries and creations leading to more possibilities for the future, which ideally drive researchers with their curiosity, pride, belief, and responsibilities.</p>

            Mar. 2024,<br>when I was talking to my mom
        </div>
        <p>Now I get why I'm saying this. What I really wanted to say was that I found working in all these fields are subjectively the same, and the only difference would be the objectives. In addition, objectively, the objectives are not pari passu. Some are having dominant forces over others, which people would normally ignore when they are working.</p>

        <h2>About Supervised Learning</h2>
        <p>Not until now do I realize that the terms "supervised" and "unsupervised" are actually referring to the supervision's reliance on human labor instead of the model itself. Models would be supervised by their objectives in both cases. Hence, it can be properer to name them as "human-supervised" and "non-human-supervised". (just kidding)</p>

        </div>
        <p>Previous to my junior year, I had to form an image for everything before I allowed myself to memorize any conclusions. I think that can explain why Einstein's being not interested in math at first, as well as my failure in my math final exams in sophomore year. I'll never try such stupid stuff as forming graphic understanding for every single topic again. There shall be more strategies to store and retrieve concepts. In fact, even physics topics nowadays have gone far beyond intuitive empiricism, and Einstein did spend years getting used to Remannian geometry.</p>
        <!-- By the way, the way that we are forming images and sense of space can be referred to as "space and movement empiricism", I suppose. -->

        <h2>From Philosophy to Science</h2>

            "A little science estranges a man from God; a lot of science brings him back."

                Francis Bacon
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Bacon is considered as the founder of "experimental philosophy", which is exactly what "science" means, I suppose. A lot of people are confused by the role of philosophy nowadays, and not aware of their being philosophers themselves, I suppose. Science is no more than a methodology for philosophy, and that's where the name of the degree "doctor of philosophy" comes, I suppose.</p>
