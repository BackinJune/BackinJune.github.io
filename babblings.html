            It's indeed super impressive for current language models to capture grammar and possibly concepts so well. However, grammar is a finite set of rules, while what're even more charming can be the infinite possibilities behind reasoning.

        <h2>The Living Trade</h2>
        <p>
            Basically we are all trading for living necessities with particular parts of our body, most of which will withstand wear or tear for use. However, brain can be considered as one of the rare exceptions that will even normally be polished after use. This leads to two benefits of living on brain -- sustainability of the trade and its continued growth.

            Obviously I didn't see that every work requires a brain, but it still makes sense on the perspective of wear versus polishment. They are like bases being below and above one in an exponential function. Theoritically if ones start with wearing themselves for living at the very begining, they will never get the chance to excape. However, things will get more interesting if AI gets involved, for both those're embodied and those not.

            Previous to my junior year, I had to form an image for everything before I allowed myself to memorize any conclusions. I think that can explain why Einstein's being not interested in math at first, as well as my failure in my math final exams in sophomore year. I'll never try such stupid stuff as forming graphic understanding for every single topic again. There shall be more strategies to store and retrieve concepts. In fact, even physics topics nowadays have gone far beyond intuitive empiricism, and Einstein did spend years getting used to Remannian geometry.
