        <h2>About Social Objectives</h2>
        <p>There are objectives in every field, which are rankings in video games, power in politics, and assets in business. In academia, that would be discoveries and creations leading to infinite possibilities for the future, which ideally drive researchers with their curiosity, pride, belief, and responsibilities.</p>

        <h2>About Supervised Learning</h2>
        <p>Not until now do I realize that the terms "supervised" and "unsupervised" are actually referring to the supervision's reliance on human labor instead of the model itself. Models would be supervised by their objectives in both cases. Hence, it can be properer to name them as "human-supervised" and "non-human-supervised". (just kidding)</p>

        <p>Previous to my junior year, I had to form an image for everything before I allowed myself to memorize any conclusions. I think that can explain why Einstein's being not interested in math at first, as well as my failure in my math final exams in sophomore year. I'll never try such stupid stuff as forming graphic understanding for every single topic again. There shall be more strategies to store and retrieve concepts. In fact, even physics topics nowadays have gone far beyond intuitive empiricism.</p>
        <!-- By the way, the way that we are forming images and sense of space can be referred to as "space and movement empiricism", I suppose. -->
