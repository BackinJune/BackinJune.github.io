            <h2>Hallo!</h2>
            <p>I'm Bingjun Guo, an undergraduate student from ZJU-UIUC Institute majoring in Computer Engineering. With the support of both my constant passion in science and solid engineering literacy, my research interests mainly focus on machine learning and data science. Recently I am more interested in extending representation learning approaches on structural data. I am also wishing to discover more brain-inspired structures for deep learning through my courses this semester. The final aim of my research would be helping improve the mode of production and education for the broad society with reliable, general, and interpretable artificial intelligence. Currently, I am on UIUC campus for the junior year of my undergraduate study. More information about me will be updated soon (hopefully).</p>

            <h2>Course Work Threads</h2>
            <p>In this section I'm going to introduce the courses that I have taken, following a couple of critical disciplines which will probably play critical roles in my future research work. I will also demonstrate how they inspired me with brand-new viewpoints to inspect the world, as well as how I feel about my participation in these courses. (hopefully this page won't be caught by the professors)</p>
