            <strong>Hallo</strong>! I am an <strong>undergraduate</strong> student from <a href="https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/en/college"><strong>ZJU-UIUC Institute</strong></a> majoring in <strong>Computer Engineering</strong>. With the support of both my great passion in science and solid engineering literacy, my research interests mainly focus on machine learning and data science. I have been working on <b>representation learning</b> on <b>structured data</b>, which I'm recently trying expanding to <b>multimodalities</b>. I'm also interested in more insights from brain for machine learning, though it's likely that I will set this aside for a while and turn to the math approaches that estimate the unsolvable problems next semester. The final aim of my research would be helping improve the mode of production and education for the broad society with reliable, general, and interpretable artificial intelligence. I have just finished my wonderful junior year at UIUC and will be in Zhejiang for my exciting <b>senior</b> year. Below are several sections in which <b>titles are links</b>. Feel free to explore them! More about me will be updated soon <span class="whisper">(hopefully)</span>.

        <a href="courses.html", class="section"><h1> Course Work Threads </h1></a>
        <p>
            Here I'm going to introduce courses that I have taken following a couple of critical disciplines. I will also demonstrate how they inspired me with brand-new viewpoints to inspect the world, as well as how I feel about my participation in these courses. <span class="whisper">(Hopefully this page won't be caught by the professors.)</span>

            Here comes my favorite part, and title would be quite reasonable as Newton specified that we are all playing with stones and shells on the seashore of the "vast imponderable ocean of truth".

        <p>Rousseau made his confessions, which has been imitated by many people later on. However, as I am neither that evil nor that pessimistic, I would rather like to share my gratitude here to those who has endured the imperfect me(s) and guided me towards where I am.</p>
