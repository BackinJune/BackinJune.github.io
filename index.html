            <strong>Hallo</strong>! I am an <strong>undergraduate</strong> student from <a href="https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/en/college"><strong>ZJU-UIUC Institute</strong></a> majoring in <strong>Computer Engineering</strong>. With the support of both my great passion in science and solid engineering literacy, my research interests mainly focus on machine learning and data science. Recently I am more interested in enhancing concurrent models' ability to <strong>understand structural data and generate</strong> contents accordingly. I'm also wishing to discover more <strong>brain-inspired</strong> methods and structures for machine learning through my courses this semester. The final aim of my research would be helping improve the mode of production and education for the broad society with reliable, general, and interpretable artificial intelligence. Currently, I am on UIUC campus for the <strong>junior year</strong> of my undergraduate study. Below are several sections in which <strong>titles are links</strong> to the content. Please feel free to explore them! More about me will be updated soon (hopefully).

        <h1><a href="courses.html", class="selfref"> Course Work Threads </a></h1>
        <p>In this section I'm going to introduce courses that I have taken following a couple of critical disciplines. I will also demonstrate how they inspired me with brand-new viewpoints to inspect the world, as well as how I feel about my participation in these courses. (hopefully this page won't be caught by the professors)</p>

        <h1><a href="projects.html", class="selfref"> Past Projects </a></h1>
        <p>Here are the projects that I have been working on. Most of them were accomplished in cooperation with my classmates. </p>

        <p>Here comes my favorite part, and title would be quit reasonable as Newton specified that we are all playing with stones and shells on the seashore of the "vast imponderable ocean of truth".</p>

        <h1><a href="acknowledgements.html", class="selfref"> Acknowledgements </a></h1>
        <p>Rousseau made his confessions, which has been imitated by many people later on. However, as I am neither that evil not that pessimistic, I would rather like to share my gratitude here to those who has endured the imperfect mes and guided me towards here.</p>
