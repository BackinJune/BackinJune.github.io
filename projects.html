        <p>Here are the projects that I have been working on. Almost all of them were accomplished in cooperation with my classmates. Since most of them seem a bit weird now, this section will be updated slower.</p>

            It's gonna be sure that every single one of us (who didn't fail the course) would place this project in resume.

            When this project was handed us, it was just a few keywords, and we were just a few blank minds. One of us (not me) had a bit practical experience with deep learning, and none of us was familiar with any language model then. After the first week, the other two group members was responsible for

We processed signals and applied control completely at hardware level. It was said that we were the only group achieving so.
